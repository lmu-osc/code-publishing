# Repository for the Reproducible Manuscripts Quarto Workshop

This repository is for day 2 of the self-paced Reproducible Manuscripts Quarto Workshop.
The repository is structured as follows:

1. The folder "01_Example" contains a **minimal reproducible example** with a Quarto manuscript using the Palmer Penguins data set. All necessary files are there, including the .qmd-file, the data in .csv format, a .bib-file with references, and a citation style csl.-file.
2. The folder "02_Practise" contains the data in .csv format, a .bib-file with references, a .cls-file for *apaquarto*, and a citation style .csl-file. These are necessary components to **recreate the minimal reproducible example as a practise**, and would have to be copy-pasted anyway. Other files, like the .RProj-, renv-, and .qmd-files will be created by the participants during the practise in this folder.
3. The folder "03_Supplement" contains a **checklist** that participants can use to go over their project at the end and see which reproducibility measures they were able to implement and how to take it one step further.
4. The file "Instructions.qmd" contains the detailed instructions for day 2, i.e. how to execute the example, recreate it, apply the techniques to own data, and use the checklist, step-by-step.

If you encounter any issues during the workshop that you cannot resolve through a quick Google search, please approach the workshop instructors.
