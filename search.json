    "section": "Which License to Choose?",
    "text": "Which License to Choose?\nMany boilerplate licenses are available to apply to your work. Which license is appropriate depends on several factors, including existing licenses in place and the type of work, but also your personal considerations. We strongly recommend to apply a free/open license to your work, which means that the work “can be freely studied, applied, copied and/or modified, by anyone, for any purpose” (Möller et al. 2015). Importantly, this also means that others do not need to ask or notify the author and that they can use it for commercial purposes. By the choice of license, authors can, however, demand that they are credited, that the original license is indicated, that modifications are indicated, that derivative works are only shared under the same license, and that no further restrictions are imposed on the work. Software licenses may additionally require to make the source code available to everybody the software is shared with. Because there are many free/open licenses available, the licenses discussed here only represent a recommended subset.\n\n\nIf you would like to choose a license not listed here, it should be appropriate for the type of work in question and be compatible with the dominant copyleft license in the respective community (see also Note 3). For software that’s almost universally the GPLv3 and for writing, image, audio, and video that’s mostly the CC BY-SA 4.0. For data, no dominant copyleft license has emerged yet, so any of ODbL 1.0, CDLA Sharing 1.0, and CC BY-SA 4.0 are acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: A Note on Terminology\n\n\n\n\n\nThe terms free and open, especially with regard to software, come with a history. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded in 1985 to protect “four essential freedoms” (2021) of a program’s user. These are the freedoms to use, study, share, and improve a program. Software whose users legally and practically have these freedoms (because, among other things, they have access to its source code) is considered free. The four freedoms are seen as vital for a society as a whole in the sense that they enable sharing, cooperation and ultimately freedom in general. The FSF maintains a list of software licenses that it considers to be protecting the four freedoms. Sometimes the term libre (Spanish and French for free) is used to make a distinction from gratis software. You can learn more about free software at Write Free Software.\nThe Open Source Initiative (OSI), which was founded in 1998, follows a more pragmatic approach. It is concerned with developing high-quality software, for which everyone’s ability to obtain, modify and contribute back the source code is considered beneficial. Access to the source code is one out of multiple conditions for software to be considered open source by the OSI (2007), which equally maintains a list of approved licenses.\nAccess to the source code is a necessary, but not sufficient requirement both for free software and for open source software. Conversely, both can (and frequently are) sold for money, as their respective criteria only apply once one has access to the software. Throughout this tutorial, we write “free/open license” to mean a license that is approved by either the FSF or the OSI. Software which is neither but makes available its source code is sometimes referred to as source-available software.\nApart from software, the term open access has often been used for works that are available at no cost. For example, this is the commonality of bronze, green, hybrid, gold, and diamond/platinum open access articles, which otherwise vary in the rights that are granted to readers. In 2002, the Budapest Open Access Initiative declared that open access additionally includes the right to use articles for any purpose, and in 2003, the Bethesda Statement and the Berlin Declaration added the right to make derivative works.\nTwo other notable definitions include the Open Definition (Open Knowledge Foundation 2016), which was first drafted in 2005, and the definition of Free Cultural Works (Möller et al. 2015), for which the open editing phase began in 2006. They are largely viewed as compatible with one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting License?\nFirst, if you adapt (i.e., modify, build on) a work by others you need to determine if it is provided to you under a free/open license. If yes, we recommend you to make your contribution available under the same license.3 For example, if you adapt code published in another paper, choose the same license for your modifications. The same applies if there are strong community norms to use a particular free/open license.4 Importantly, as discussed before, you are generally not allowed to adapt a work not published under a free/open license.You can determine whether a license is free/open by searching for its name in the SPDX License List and looking for at least one Y in the two columns FSF Free/Libre? and OSI Approved?\n\n\nWork Type?\nIf you create a new work and no strong community norms suggest a particular license, you need to choose the license yourself. Which license to choose depends on the type of work you create. Software licenses, for example, may consider that the source code is the preferred form for making modifications, while licenses for data can differentiate between the database and any works produced from it. We have created a flowchart that covers the most likely types of works you will create as a researcher: software, writing (i.e., text), images, audio, video, and data (see Figure 1). This flowchart always recommends the most permissive license possible to maximize reuse – below we provide two additional flowcharts that allow for more choices. Click on the name of a license to learn more about it.\nNote, that for data you have, at least in principle, the option to apply separate licenses to the individual entries and the collective database. For example, if you were to create a database of artworks by others, those artworks would be licensed individually as chosen by the artists, but the license for the database as a whole could be chosen by you. The latter includes the structure of the database (e.g., the selection of entries and field names) and any sui generis database rights. However, if the content was created by you, we recommend you to choose the same license for both content and database. Metadata, in particular, should always be licensed under CC0 1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  start(\"We want&lt;br&gt;to choose&lt;br&gt;a license.\") --\"We adapted a work by&lt;br&gt;others shared under a&lt;br&gt;free/open license.\"--&gt; use_existing_license[\"&lt;em&gt;Use its license&lt;/em&gt;\"]\n  start --\"We created the work&lt;br&gt;entirely by ourselves.\"--&gt; norm(\"Community norm&lt;br&gt;regarding license?\")\n  \n  norm --\"Exists\"--&gt; follow_existing_norms[\"&lt;em&gt;Follow that norm&lt;/em&gt;\"]\n  norm --\"Does not&lt;br&gt;exist\"--&gt; type(\"Work type?\")\n  \n  type --\"Software\"--&gt; apache[\"Apache 2.0\"]\n  type --\"Writing, image, audio, video\"--&gt; cc0[\"CC0 1.0\"]\n  type --\"Data(base)\"--&gt; existing_license_data(\"Adapting individual&lt;br&gt;data entries by others?\")\n  \n  existing_license_data --\"No, we created them&lt;br&gt;entirely by ourselves.\"--&gt; cc0_data[\"CC0 1.0 &lt;em&gt;for database&lt;br&gt;and its content&lt;/em&gt;\"]\n  existing_license_data --\"Yes, they were&lt;br&gt;shared under a&lt;br&gt;free/open license.\"--&gt; use_existing_license_data[\"&lt;em&gt;Use their license&lt;br&gt;for content and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;CC0 1.0 &lt;em&gt;for&lt;br&gt;the database&lt;/em&gt;\"]\n  \n  click apache href \"https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/\"\n  click cc0 href \"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\"\n  click cc0_data href \"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Flowchart for Choosing a License\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2: Other Work Types\n\n\n\n\n\nOne should be cautious about the restrictions of licenses applied to the following types of works:\n\nfonts: Copyleft licenses applied to fonts can a special case: If a font is put under the license CC BY-SA 4.0, any documents containing texts using that font will probably be derivative works and have to be put under the same license if shared. If the intent is that only derived fonts, if published, have to be put under the same license, the SIL Open Font License 1.1 is an appropriate choice. Note, however, that it doesn’t require attribution for usage. If no copyleft mechanism is intended, CC0 1.0 also works for fonts.\ntemplates and LaTeX packages: If a template or, for this purpose, a LaTeX package, is licensed under a copyleft software license such as the AGPLv3, every work that is a derivative of the template or that uses the LaTeX package has to put under the same license, if shared (Koppor 2016). And if a document contained source code covered by the GPLv3, the same license would also apply to the document (MadHatter 2022).\ndatabase content: If the work produced from a database (the “output”) is a derivative of the content in the database, the output is subject to the restrictions laid out in the license. For example, if geospatial data were to be licensed under CC BY 4.0, all maps produced from the data would likely need to fulfill this license’s obligation for unrestricted access if shared (see Poole 2017). Similarly, following an example from Matt (2009) if one were to choose the copyleft license CC BY-SA 4.0 for this purpose, any map that is a derivative of the data would also need to licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 (or a compatible license) if shared. If the intention is to only have derivative databases under the same license, one might want to choose the ODbL 1.0 for the database, as it was specifically designed not to apply to works produced from the data in the database. Otherwise CC0 1.0 is an excellent choice for data.\nworks in the public domain: If a work is already in the public domain, it should be marked using the PDM 1.0, rather than applying a waiver such as the CC0 1.0 (or even another license).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyleft?\nThe consequence of applying a permissive license to your work is that others may distribute their modifications to it under stricter terms, possibly without a free/open license. You may prefer that everybody who receives somebody else’s adaptations of your work enjoys the same rights that you granted to them. This can be achieved by copyleft licenses.5 For software, they come in two flavors:\n\nWeak copyleft licenses only require that modifications to the software itself are licensed under the same or a compatible license if shared. For example, if you create and publish software under a weak copyleft license, others who modify it and put their version on the internet have to apply the same license. However, people who merely use your software in their own work which they make publicly available can choose any license for it.\nStrong copyleft licenses, on the other side, insist that any larger works that use the copyleft-licensed software must also be licensed under the same or a compatible license if shared. For example, if your software were to be put under a strong copyleft license, everybody publishing software that uses your software would need to put it under the same license. Because of only few rulings in courts, the extent of this requirement is disputed (Wikipedia contributors 2024).\n\nNote, however, that the copyleft licenses we discuss here do not mandate sharing. Copyleft (and attribution) clauses are only triggered if the work is shared (Creative Commons 2015). It is also worth reiterating that these licenses do not restrict the original author(s): They are still permitted to distribute their work under a different license and without sharing the source code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: Projects Involving R Code\n\n\n\nIn most cases, the output of software, like images or tables, does not depend on its license. Therefore, if you use an R package under a copyleft license to create content, you are likely the copyright owner. However, if the output is based in data, it can be considered a derivative work and the license of the data also applies.\nIf a Quarto document contains both R code and writing, one may wonder what type of license to apply. It is possible to make such a file simultaneously available under two licenses, at the choice of the recipient: Either under a specified software license, or under a Creative Commons license6. This is called dual-licensing and makes it easier to reuse both rendered PDF as well as the code. For example, one could write:\n\nThe Quarto files in this project are made available under CC BY-SA 4.0, or (at your option) under the terms of the Apache Software License 2.0.\n\nIt is disputed whether software that uses an R package under AGPLv3 or GPLv37 can only be published under a GPL-compatible license – or even has to be published under the same license. Posit, the company behind RStudio, does not believe that to be the case (see also Wickham and Bryan 2023). You can learn which license an installed package uses via packageDescription(\"&lt;PACKAGE_NAME&gt;\", fields = \"License\"). And to identify which licenses are being used by the R packages your project depends on, you can use the following code:\ndeps &lt;- renv::dependencies()$Package |&gt;\n  unique() |&gt;\n  pak::pkg_deps(dependencies = NA) |&gt;\n  getElement(\"package\")\nunique(installed.packages(fields=\"License\")[deps, \"License\"])\n\n\nWe have prepared two advanced license flowcharts, one for software, writing, images, audio, and video in Figure 2 and one for data in Figure 3 where you can make additional choices. Note, however, that especially the advanced flowchart for licensing data is quite complex and we recommend you to seek legal counsel if you want to be sure.\n\n\nAttribution, State Changes, and Anti-DRM?\nThe advanced license flowcharts also allow you to make additional decisions:\n\nAttribution means whether recipients of your work are required to provide attribution to you. For software licenses, this is called a copyright notice. Note that even if attribution is not a requirement of the license, good scientific practice demands that appropriate citations are made.\nState changes means that recipients need to indicate if changes were made.\nAnti-DRM means that when others share your work they are not allowed to apply technological measures restricting anything that the license permits. DRM is an abbreviation for digital rights management.\n\nFrom the Creative Commons licenses, only CC0 1.0 does not require providing attribution. All software licenses in Figure 2 require providing attribution, although only Apache 2.0 and AGPLv3 require others to indicate changes. For data, the ODbL 1.0 allows for technological measures that restrict the work only if a version of the database is provided in parallel without such measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3: Other Restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated before, a free/open license must allow creating derivative works and must allow exercising the rights granted by it for any purpose, including commercial use. There are a few good resources on the reasoning behind that (e.g., see Klimpel 2013; Open Data Institute 2015), but we would like to highlight one reason in particular.\nWith the rights provided by free/open licenses comes the possibility to build on and combine multiple works by different authors, which is essential for any cultural and scientific activity. However, this is only possible if the various licenses involved are compatible with each other. For example, one is allowed to remix two figures if the first is licensed under CC BY 4.0 and the second under CC BY-SA 4.0 because the licenses were written to be compatible with each other (compare Creative Commons 2024b). Also note that CC BY-SA 4.0 is one-way compatible with the GPLv3, which in turn is compatible with the AGPLv3.\nHowever, applying a restriction such as only permitting non-commercial use or not allowing derivative works creates silos of works which are mutually incompatible with each other. Put differently, one cannot share a remix of two works where one is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 and the other only allows non-commercial use. In order to avoid silos, one should only choose license which are compatible with the dominant copyleft license in the respective community (Lämmerhirt 2017; Wheeler 2014). If you would like to learn more about the different types of compatibility, we recommend you to read the article “A Quick Guide to Software Licensing for the Scientist-Programmer” by Morin, Urban, and Sliz (2012). The following diagram provides an overview of the compatibility of various licenses:\n\n\n\n“Open data-capable license interoperability” by Robbie Morrison licensed under CC BY 4.0.

    "section": "Applying the License",
    "text": "Applying the License\nHaving selected the licenses of your choice – you might need multiple ones depending on the types of works your project contains –, we encourage you to read through the full license text (or at least a legal summary) to understand their effect. Then, you can record the license of existing content and apply the licenses of your own contributions. Mostly, this just means indicating which license applies to which file or folder, usually in the project’s README (among other places), whose creation will be discussed in “Add a README”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution 2: License Versions Are Important\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that we mostly refer to licenses using a name and a version number. This is because the organizations that created the licenses sometimes publish updated versions to accommodate for developments in copyright law and the communities that use the licenses. For example, the Creative Commons licenses (that start with CC) were first published in 2002. Since then, the possibility to relicense under compatible licenses has been added (v3.0), a 30-day window to correct license violations has been established to combat copyleft trolls, and sui generis database rights are covered explicitly (v4.0). There are many more subtle differences between license versions, therefore it is important to indicate which license version exactly one is referring to, as the license of a work does not “update” automatically.\nFor the AGPLv3 it is even recommended to state whether a work is licensed under exactly the indicated version of the license or, alternatively, also under newer versions of the license (Stallman 2022).\n\n\nFor example, the apaquarto extension that you included in your project is a work by others.8 You need to indicate its license so that others know what they are allowed to do – and, of course, you need to comply with any terms yourself, such as retaining the copyright notice.9 In contrast, if it were not for this tutorial, the manuscript would contain your own work and you would need to indicate under which license you provide it to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2: Follow the Help Provided by the License Authors\n\n\n\nFor all the licenses recommended in this tutorial, the organizations that created these licenses provide more information on how to apply them to your work:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApache 2.0\nMPL 2.0\nAGPLv3\n\n\n\n\nCC licenses\nODbL 1.0\n\n\n\n\nCreative Commons even provides a range of considerations for licensors and licensees (Creative Commons 2013) and an interactive chooser which you can use to create text snippet that you can copy and paste to the desired location.\n\n\nWhile it is common to state the chosen license(s) in the README, usually one of the following actions is taken in addition:\nIn the simplest case, one just creates a file called LICENSE.txt where the full text of the license is copied verbatim. This is a practice propagated by GitHub, which provides instructions for many licenses via ChooseALicense.com. However, if the project is not completely covered by one single license, this practice may become unwieldy. For example, if a project contains different types of works by different authors, the LICENSE.txt needs to detail which file is covered by which license(s), along with any copyright notices.\nIndividual programming languages also have their own way of stating which license a package is distributed under. For R packages, this is usually set by the field License in the file DESCRIPTION (Wickham and Bryan 2023).\nFinally, Note 4 explains how to use the REUSE specification to make the choice of license machine-readable. This is the approach we recommend taking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 4: Using REUSE to Record Licenses\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery major free/open license has a unique SPDX identifier which allows communicating the license choice unequivocally. We will be using that to indicate the license for every file in your project, along with the year of publication and the copyright holder. To do this, we add a comment to the beginning of every file and include the two tags SPDX-FileCopyrightText and SPDX-License-Identifier. How this works depends on the file type, as the syntax for a comment varies.\nFor example, if you previously created the file create_data_dictionary.R, you can now add the following comment to the beginning of the file, replacing &lt;YEAR&gt; and &lt;NAME&gt; with the current year and your name – of course, you can also choose a different license:\n\n\ncreate_data_dictionary.R\n\n# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: &lt;YEAR&gt; &lt;NAME&gt;\n#\n# SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0\n\nYou need to use # to start the comment because this is the symbol that starts comment lines in R scripts. Alternatively, you can use the reuse tool to add these information for you. After installing it with…\n\n\nTerminal\n\npip install reuse\n\n…you can add the copyright information using the following command – the current year will be added automatically:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nreuse annotate --copyright=\"&lt;NAME&gt;\" --license=\"CC0-1.0\" create_data_dictionary.R\n\nIn many cases, the reuse tool will figure out the appropriate comment style for you. If this is not the case, as currently with Quarto files, you can tell it directly which comment style to use (html in this case):\n\n\nTerminal\n\nreuse annotate --copyright=\"Josephine Zerna &lt;josephine.zerna@tu-dresden.de&gt;\" --copyright=\"Christoph Scheffel &lt;christoph_scheffel@tu-dresden.de&gt;\" --copyright=\"Florian Kohrt\" --license=\"CC-BY-4.0\" --style=html Manuscript.qmd\n\nThis adds the following header to Manuscript.qmd:\n\n\nManuscript.qmd\n\n&lt;!--\nSPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Christoph Scheffel &lt;christoph_scheffel@tu-dresden.de&gt;\nSPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Florian Kohrt\nSPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Josephine Zerna &lt;josephine.zerna@tu-dresden.de&gt;\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0\n--&gt;\n\nNote that Manuscript.qmd was provided to you under CC BY 4.0, which is what you indicate with the previous comment. If you edited the file, you may also add yourself.10\nSometimes, there are file types which do not allow for adding the license information inside them, such as PDF and CSV files. For these, a corresponding .license file can be created. Try the following command which indicates that the data were published under CC0 1.0:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nreuse annotate --copyright=\"Kristen Gorman\" --license=\"CC0-1.0\" Data.csv\n\nYou will notice that this creates another file called Data.csv.license containing the relevant information:\n\n\nData.csv.license\n\nSPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Kristen Gorman\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0\n\nIf you want to indicate the license for all files in a particular folder, you can create a filed called REUSE.toml and add an [[annotations]] table for them:\n\n\nREUSE.toml\n\nversion = 1\n\n# apaquarto extension from https://github.com/wjschne/apaquarto\n[[annotations]]\npath = \"_extensions/wjschne/apaquarto/*\"\nSPDX-FileCopyrightText = \"2024 William Joel Schneider &lt;w.joel.schneider@gmail.com&gt;\"\nSPDX-License-Identifier = \"CC0-1.0\"\n\nFinally, there may be some minor files which are build artifacts. You can either add them to your .gitignore file or use the CC0 1.0 license/waiver with a copyright tag such as SPDX-FileCopyrightText: NONE to assert that there is no copyright holder. For more information, also discussing other corner cases, you can read their Frequently Asked Questions.\nOnce you are done, you can download the texts of all indicated licenses using…\n\n\nTerminal\n\nreuse download --all\n\n…and verify that you did not miss a file by running…\n\n\nTerminal\n\nreuse lint\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of how exactly the licenses are added to the project, this is a good opportunity to verify one last time that all third party content is provided to you under a free/open license and that you comply with it. Please add a license to your project now, either creating a file LICENSE.txt or following the REUSE standard.",

    "text": "Decide on Structure\nBefore adding your project files, it is helpful to decide on a directory structure, that is, how to call each file and where to put it. In general, the directory structure should facilitate understanding a project by breaking it into logical chunks. There is no single best solution, as a good structure depends on where a project’s complexity lies. However, it is usually helpful if the different files and folders reflect the execution order. For example, if there are multiple data processing stages, one can possibly differentiate input (raw data), intermediate (processed data), and output files (e.g., figures) and put them into separate folders. Similarly, the corresponding code files (e.g., preparation, modeling, visualization) can be prefixed with increasing numbers.\nLuckily, there are already numerous proposals for how to organize one’s project files, both general (e.g., Wilson et al. 2017; Project TIER 2021) as well as specific to a particular programming language (e.g., Marwick, Boettiger, and Mullen 2018; Vuorre and Crump 2021) or journal (Vilhuber 2021).

It was made available under the license CC0 1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 1: Consider Legal Restrictions Before Sharing\n\n\n\nEverything you put into the project folder will be shared publicly. For reasons of reproducibility, this should include the data you analyze. Of course, you should only share them to the extent you are allowed to, taking into account:\n\napplicable privacy laws (e.g., the GDPR for European citizens),\ncontractual obligations (e.g., with your data provider),\ncopyright of the data and their particular structure, and\nany sui generis database right.\n\nPrivacy laws and contractual obligations may require you to create a completely anonymized or synthetic dataset1 (if possible), or prohibit any sharing of data, in which case you should provide a reference to a data repository where they can be obtained from. For further information, you can watch the talk “Data anonymity” by Felix Schönbrodt recorded during the LMU Open Science Center Summer School 2023 and have a look at the accompanying slides.\nPurely factual data such as measurements are usually not copyrightable, but literary or artistic works that cross the threshold of originality are. Additionally, in some jurisdictions data can be subject to sui generis database rights which prevent extracting substantial parts of a database. As a consequence, you need to ensure that you own or have authority to share the data with respect to copyright and similar rights, and to license it to others (see “Choose a License”).\n\n\nWhen publishing a data set, it is important to document the meaning (e.g., units) and possible values of its variables. This is typically done with a data dictionary (also called a codebook). In the following, we will demonstrate how to create a simple data dictionary using the R packages tinylabels, datawizard, and tinytable. You can install them now using:\n\n\nConsole\n\nrenv::install(c(\n  \"tinylabels\",\n  \"datawizard\",\n  \"tinytable\"\n))\n\nYou can put the code that follows for creating the data dictionary into a new file called create_data_dictionary.R.\nUsing tinylabels we can add labels to the variables of a data.frame in R:2\n\n\n\ncreate_data_dictionary.R\n\n## dat &lt;- read.csv(\"Data.csv\")\n\ndescriptions &lt;- c(\n  species = \"a character string denoting penguin species\",\n  island = \"a character string denoting island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica\",\n  bill_length_mm = \"a number denoting bill length (millimeters)\",\n  bill_depth_mm = \"a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)\",\n  flipper_length_mm = \"an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)\",\n  body_mass_g = \"an integer denoting body mass (grams)\",\n  sex = \"a character string denoting penguin sex\",\n  year = \"an integer denoting the study year\"\n)\ntinylabels::variable_label(dat) &lt;- descriptions\n\n\nSubsequently, datawizard can be employed to create the data dictionary containing the name and label, but also some other information about each variable:\n\n\n\n\n\ndatawizard: Easy Data Wrangling and Statistical Transformations\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate_data_dictionary.R\n\n(dict &lt;- datawizard::data_codebook(dat) |&gt;\n  subset(select

put the HTML file into the project folder as well.\n\n\n\n\n\ntinytable: Simple and Configurable Tables\n\n\n\n\ncreate_data_dictionary.R\n\ntinytable::save_tt(dict, output = \"data_dictionary.html\")\n\nA human-readable data dictionary is necessary for making one’s research reproducible and the example we provided demonstrates only the bare minimum. A full data documentation including measurement instruments, sampling procedures, appropriate weighting, contact information, and more information about the study can be created with the R package pointblank. And one could go even further by making the information machine-readable in a standardized way. We provide an optional example of that in Note 1. If you want to learn more about the sharing of research data, have a look at the tutorial “FAIR Data management”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: Create Machine-Readable Variable Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example demonstrates how the title and description of the data set, the description of the variables and their possible values are stored in a machine-readable way.\ntable_info &lt;- c(\n  title = \"penguins dataset\",\n  description = \"Size measurements for adult foraging penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica\"\n)\ndescriptions &lt;- c(\n  species = \"a character string denoting penguin species\",\n  island = \"a character string denoting island in Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica\",\n  bill_length_mm = \"a number denoting bill length (millimeters)\",\n  bill_depth_mm = \"a number denoting bill depth (millimeters)\",\n  flipper_length_mm = \"an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)\",\n  body_mass_g = \"an integer denoting body mass (grams)\",\n  sex = \"a character string denoting penguin sex\",\n  year = \"an integer denoting the study year\"\n)\nvals &lt;- list(\n  species = c(\"Adelie\", \"Gentoo\", \"Chinstrap\"),\n  island = c(\"Torgersen\", \"Biscoe\", \"Dream\"),\n  sex = c(\"male\", \"female\"),\n  year = c(2007, 2008, 2009)\n)\nGenerally, metadata are either stored embedded into the data or externally, for example, in a separate file. We will use the “frictionless data” standard, where metadata are stored separately.\nSpecifically, one can use the R package frictionless to create a schema which describes the structure of the data. For the purpose of the following code, it is just a nested list that we edit to include our own information. We also explicitly record in the schema that missing values are stored in the data file as NA and that the data are licensed under CC0 1.0. Finally, the package is used to create a metadata file that contains the schema.\n# Read data and create schema\ndat_filename &lt;- \"Data.csv\"\ndat &lt;- read.csv(dat_filename)\ndat_schema &lt;- frictionless::create_schema(dat)\n\n# Add descriptions to the fields\ndat_schema$fields &lt;- lapply(dat_schema$fields, \\(x) {\n  c(x, description = descriptions[[x$name]])\n})\n\n# Record possible values\ndat_schema$fields &lt;- lapply(dat_schema$fields, \\(x) {\n  if (x$name %in% names(vals)) {\n    modifyList(x, list(constraints = list(enum = vals[[x$name]])))\n  } else {\n    x\n  }\n})\n\n# Define missing values\ndat_schema$missingValues &lt;- c(\"\", \"NA\")\n\n# Create package with license info and write it\ndat_package &lt;- frictionless::create_package() |&gt;\n  frictionless::add_resource(\n    resource_name = \"penguins\",\n    data = dat_filename,\n    schema = dat_schema,\n    title = table_info[[\"title\"]],\n    description = table_info[[\"description\"]],\n    licenses = list(list(\n      name = \"CC0-1.0\",\n      path = \"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\",\n      title = \"CC0 1.0 Universal\"\n    ))\n  )\nfrictionless::write_package(dat_package, directory = \".\")\nThis creates the metadata file datapackage.json in the current directory. Make sure it is located in the same folder as Data.csv, as together they comprise a data package.\n\n\n\nHaving added the data and its documentation, one can view and record the utilized packages with renv…\n\n\nConsole\n\nrenv::status()\nrenv::snapshot()\n\n…and go through the commit routine:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit status\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Add data\"",

    "text": "Add Code\nIn order to have some code which you can practice to share, we have prepared a simple manuscript for you, alongside a bibliography file. The manuscript contains code together with a written narrative. Download the two files to your computer and put them into your project folder.\n\nManuscript.qmd\nBibliography.bib\n\nThe manuscript explores differences in bill length between male and female penguins, feel free to read through it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 2: Take Copyright Seriously\n\n\n\nWhen you include work by others in your project – especially if you intend to make it available publicly –, make sure you have the necessary rights to do so. Only build on existing work for which you are given an express grant of relevant rights. How do you know you are allowed to copy, edit, and share the two files linked above?\n\n\nAs the manuscript uses some new packages, install them with:\n\n\nConsole\n\nrenv::install()\n\nThe manuscript also uses the Quarto extension “apaquarto”, which needs to be installed in the project before it can be rendered:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto add --no-prompt wjschne/apaquarto\n\nAlso, you need to have a \\(\\TeX\\) distribution installed on your computer. A lightweight choice is TinyTeX, which can be installed with Quarto as follows:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto install tinytex\n\nYou should now be able to render the document using Quarto:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto render Manuscript.qmd\n\nThis should create a PDF file called Manuscript.pdf in your project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 2\n\n\n\nIf the PDF file cannot be created, try updating Quarto. It comes bundled with RStudio, however apaquarto sometimes requires more recent versions.\n\n\nWith the code being added, one can use renv again to view and record the new packages:\n\n\nConsole\n\nrenv::status()\nrenv::snapshot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 3\n\n\n\nAlways run renv::status() and resolve any inconsistencies before you commit code to your project. This way, every commit represents a working state of your project.\n\n\nFinally, make your changes known to Git:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ngit status\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Add manuscript\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 3: Beware of Credentials\n\n\n\nSometimes, a data analysis requires the interaction with online services:\n\nData may be collected from social network sites using their APIs3 or downloaded from a data repository, or\nan analysis may be conducted with the help of AI providers.\n\nIn these cases, make sure that the code you check in to Git does not contain any credentials that are required for accessing these services. Instead, make use of environment variables which are defined in a location that is excluded from version control. When programming with R, you can define them in a file called .Renviron in the root of your project folder:\n\n\n.Renviron\n\nMY_FIRST_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\nMY_SECOND_KEY=\"your_api_key_here\"\n\nWhen you start a new session from the project root, the file is automatically read by R and the environment variables can be accessed using Sys.getenv():\nquery_api(..., api_key = Sys.getenv(\"MY_FIRST_KEY\"))\nMake sure that .Renviron is added to your .gitignore file in order to exclude it from the Git repository. If you already committed a file that contains credentials, you can follow Chacon and Straub (2024).\n\n\n\nCoding Best Practices\nAlthough we provide the code in this example for you, a few things remain to be said about best practices when it comes to writing code that is readable and maintainable.\n\nUse project-relative paths. When you refer to a file within your project, write paths relative to your project root. For example, don’t write C:/Users/Public/Documents/my_project/images/result.png, instead write images/result.png.\nKeep it simple. Add complexity only when you must. Whenever there’s a boring way to do something and a clever way, go for the boring way. If the code grows increasingly complex, refactor it into separate functions and files.\nDon’t repeat yourself. Use variables and functions before you start to write (or copy-paste) the same thing twice.\nUse comments to explain why you do things. The code already shows what you do. Use comments to summarize it and explain why you do it.\nDon’t reinvent the wheel. With R, chances are that what you need to do is greatly facilitated by a package from one of many high-quality collections such as rOpenSci, r-lib, Tidyverse, or fastverse.\nThink twice about your dependencies. Every dependency increases the risk of irreproducibility in the future. Prefer packages that are well-maintained and light on dependencies4. We also recommend you to read “When should you take a dependency?” by Wickham and Bryan (2023).\nFail early, often and noisily. Whenever you expect a certain state, use assertions to be sure. In R, you can use stopifnot() to make sure that a condition is actually true.\nTest your code. Test your code with scenarios where you know what the result should be. Turn bugs you discovered into test cases. Use linting tools, for example, the R package lintr.\nRead through a style guide and follow it. A style guide is a set of stylistic conventions that improve the code quality. R users are recommended to read Wickham’s (2022) “Tidyverse style guide” and use the R package styler. Python users may benefit from reading the “Style Guide for Python Code” by Rossum, Warsaw, and Coghlan (2013). And even if you don’t follow a style guide, be consistent.\n\nThis is only a brief summary and there is much more to be learned about coding practices. If you want to dive deeper we recommend the following resources:\n\n“Tidy design principles” (Wickham 2023)\n“The Good Research Code Handbook” (Mineault and Nozawa 2021)\n“The Art of UNIX Programming” (Raymond 2003)\n\n\n“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”\n— Martin Fowler, British software engineer",

    "text": "The project is now ready to be deposited for long-term archival. When considering an appropriate repository, there are a few questions to ponder (excerpt from Jackson and The Software Sustainability Institute 2018, with footnotes removed, licensed under CC BY 4.0):\n\nDoes the digital repository give you a unique persistent digital identifier for your deposit?\nPersistent digital identifiers are identifiers that are provided under the assumption that they, and the digital objects they refer to, will remain available long term. Examples of unique persistent digital identifiers include DOIs and ARKs. The use of persistent digital identifiers for research outputs, including papers, data and software, and the use of these for citation purposes, is becoming prevalent in research.\nCan the digital repository accommodate the size of your deposit?\nDigital repositories may have constraints on the size of deposits they accept. For example, Zenodo has a limit of 50 GB and the University of Edinburgh DataShare has a limit of 20 GB for deposits done via a browser and 100 GB otherwise.\nHas your funder or publisher recommended or mandated a digital repository to use?\nIf both a funder and publisher mandate two different digital repositories you could deposit within them both, or discuss with each to see if they will agree for you to use one only, even if it is not the one they mandate.\nAre the policies of the digital repository acceptable to you?\nThese can include terms and conditions of use; availability of the service (e.g. does the service regularly go down for updates or does it run 24/7); how resilient the service is to breakdowns; where deposits are stored; how they are stored; what are the plans for stored deposits if the repository goes out of business; how secure the storage is; how regularly it is backed up; how long backups are kept for; and what disaster recovery plans are in place. Knowing the quality of service can help you judge whether your deposit will be available to others, and yourself, even in the face of disaster. It also allows you, and your institution, to develop contingency plans should such drastic circumstances arise.\nIs the longevity of the digital repository acceptable to you?\nYou want to know that the digital repository will host your deposit for as long as you need it too, not just 6 months or so. The policies or terms and conditions of the digital repository should state this. For example, Zenodo states that their lifetime is currently 20 years and figshare guarantees 10 years of persistent availability.\nIs the digital repository free or do you have to pay a fee? If there is a fee, is this a one-off payment and can you afford it?\nIf a digital repository expects a one-off payment, to subsidise its hosting, you may be able to pay for this out of your project budget or your institution may pay this for you. It is recommended that you avoid any digital repository that expects a regular fee for the duration for which they hold the deposit, since it would most likely be unsustainable for your institution to commit to ever-increasing fees over a long term. There are many free digital repositories available.\nIs the digital repository accredited or certified?\nThe digital repository may be accredited or certified by an independent agency that reviews digital repositories according to various criteria related to its policies and processes. The presence of an accreditation or certification may provide you with an additional degree of confidence that the digital repository meets your requirements. For example, the Data Seal of Approval can be awarded to digital repositories who satisfy a set of quality guidelines relating to how they manage, preserve and make available the deposits they hold. The presence of a Data Seal of Approval could give you additional confidence that a digital repository is suitable for holding your deposit.\n\nAdditional guidance is provided by d’Aquin et al. (2023) and Garijo et al. (2022). We will cover the archival using the Software Heritage archive and Zenodo.\nFor further information, you may be interested in Software Deposit Guidance for Researchers.\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nd’Aquin, Mathieu, Fabian Kirstein, Daniela Oliveira, Sonja Schimmler, and Sebastian Urbanek. 2023. “FAIREST: A Framework for Assessing Research Repositories.” Data Intelligence 5 (1): 202–41. https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00159.\n\n\nGarijo, Daniel, Hervé Ménager, Lorraine Hwang, Ana Trisovic, Michael Hucka, Thomas Morrell, Alice Allen, Task Force on Best Practices for Software Registries, and SciCodes Consortium. 2022. “Nine Best Practices for Research Software Registries and Repositories.” PeerJ Computer Science 8 (August): e1023. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.1023.\n\n\nJackson, Michael, and The Software Sustainability Institute. 2018. “Software Deposit: Where to Deposit Software.” https://softwaresaved.github.io/software-deposit-guidance/WhereToDepositSoftware.html. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327329.",
